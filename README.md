This app represents a continued development from: Djonlagic IE, Guo M, Igue M, Kishore D, Stickgold R, Malhotra A. CPAP Restores Declarative Memory Deficit in Obstructive Sleep Apnea. AJRCCM 2021 May 1;203(9):1188-1190 https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202011-4253LE

In brief, this app is designed to test sleep-dependent memory via semantically associated word pairs. There are two modes, training and testing. In our use case, participants complete the training mode in the evening, and the testing mode in the morning after a nights sleep. 
### Training
In training mode each word pair is displayed for several seconds, before moving on to the next pair. After viewing all pairs, the participant is then presented with a repeatable training test. In this test the participant is provided with feedback on if their answer is correct. The participant is asked to repeat this training test until achieving at least 60 percent of correct word pairs. After each test a csv file with the percent correct word pairs (scoring ignores letter case and leading/trailing spaces), meta information, and participant answers is downloaded. 
### Testing
This mode tests the participant without revealing the correct answer after each entry. The test is not repeatable. At the end of the test a csv file with the percent correct word pairs (scoring ignores letter case and leading/trailing spaces), meta information, and participant answers is downloaded. 

The primary outcome is the difference between the percent of correct word pairs during the morning test vs the final evening test.
